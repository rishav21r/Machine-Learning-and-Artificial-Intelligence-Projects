Their strategy includes setting up a local manufacturing unit to produce vehicles domestically, allowing them to compete directly with established American and European car makers. To succeed, it's essential for Geely Auto to understand the factors that influence car pricing in the US, as these may differ considerably from those in China.\n\n## Problem Statement\nTo gain this understanding, Geely Auto has hired an automobile consulting firm to analyze the key determinants of car prices in the US market. The main goals of this analysis are:\n\nIdentifying the variables that significantly influence car pricing.\nAssessing the extent to which these variables account for variations in car prices.\nThe consulting firm has assembled an extensive dataset from various market surveys, covering a diverse array of car models available in the American market.\n\n# Business Goal\nThe purpose of this analysis is to create a model that can predict car prices based on the identified variables. This model will provide Geely Auto's management with insights into the relationship between car prices and different features. With these insights, they will be able to:\n\n- Adjust car designs and business strategies to meet specific pricing targets.\n- Gain a comprehensive understanding of pricing dynamics in the new market.\n\nBy utilizing this model, Geely Auto can make informed decisions to enhance their competitiveness and effectively meet market demands.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
